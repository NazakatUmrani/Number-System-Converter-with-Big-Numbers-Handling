This is a C++-written number system converter; it does not currently have a graphical user interface (GUI). It has all Conversions, I intend to turn it into a GUI program shortly.
It includes various functions that divide, add, subtract, multiplies huge numbers.
You can convert any number; there are no restrictions with this tool. Convert as many big numbers as you can.
